# Instructions on how to use this module
## Introduction
The module are separated into two formats, in MatLab script and Simulink. MatLab is necessary to open both modules. If you haven't got the software package, you can download the 1-month trial version at the [MatLab website](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html), or use a free equivalent with [Scilab](https://www.scilab.org/download/scilab-6.1.1). No library installation are necessary.

More information coming soon.
